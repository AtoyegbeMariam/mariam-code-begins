      <h2>My FIRST LESSON</h2>
      <p>
        I had my first official coding class last year, and I learned more than
        i thought i ever would. I was fortunate enough to have some friends as
        classmates, and be able to talk to them about the projects we had to
        complete. Being a freshman who has had no prior experience to coding, in
        a class full of people who have at least an idea of what methods,
        parameters, and booleans were made me feel inadequate. I tried my best
        to pretend like I was doing fine in the class, and that it was really
        easy, I was just taking my time to work on other things. But in reality,
        I struggled a lot.
